there is a pcap in the home directory, scp'ing this over and opening in
wireshark gives us the below

#+begin_example
scp level08@192.168.1.10:/home/flag08/capture.pcap .
level08@192.168.1.10's password:
capture.pcap                                                                         100% 8302     8.1KB/s   00:00
#+end_example

[[file:tcpstream.png]]

so the password looks to be =backdoor...00Rm8.ate= however the =.= are
represented by =\x7f= so the password actually is =backd00Rmate=

#+begin_example
level08@nebula:/home/flag08$ su flag08
Password:backd00Rmate
#+end_example

#+begin_example
sh-4.2$ whoami ; getflag
flag08
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
#+end_example
